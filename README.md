Project: Animal Simulation
Author: Gunamay Sachdev

This is a simulation that represents the life cycle of 5 different species: mice, birds, bears,
snakes and jaguars. This simulation models the food chain between these 5 species and accounts for multiple external factors such as weather and disease.
